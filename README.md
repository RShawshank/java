# Simple Guideline

This is  where I assign tasks to you. Below are some necessary requirements.

1. Writing you daily report every day with markdown, and post it into the `report` branch(you should create it). The daily report template is as follows:

| 学习时间(如3h) | 本日学习内容 | 明日学习计划 | 已解决问题(可附上参考资料链接) | 总结   |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | ---- |
|           |        |        |                  |      |

2. Writing you weekly report per week. Requirements are the same as daily report. Template is as follows:

| 学习时间 | 本周学习内容 | 下周学习计划 | 解决问题(可附上参考资料链接) | 总结   |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | --------------- | ---- |
|      |        |        |                 |      |

Remind to ask me if you have any question. Have fun~
