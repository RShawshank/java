# Task2

## Get familiar with basic java syntax

1. Implement two basic lists: `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.

2. Output the 9*9 ports.

3. Create an enum containning 6 types of banknote denominations. Write a switch statement for enum, and for each case,output a description of that particular currency.

4. 1) Open a text file and read one line each time(make the file name as a command line parameter). Read each line as a String and place that String Object in a `LinkedList`(written by you). Print all the lines in the `LinkedList` in the reverse order.

   2) Write the data of a text file into another file, with its line number in.

5. Create a class that implements the `Serializable` interface. Instantiate an object of the class, and write the object to a file.

6. Inherited a class from Thread and (overloaded) overrides the `run()` method. Within `run()`, print a message and call `sleep()`, repeat these operations three times and return from `run()`. Place a startup message in the builder and override `finalize()` to print a close message. Create a separate thread class that calls `System.gc()` and `System.runFinalization()` within `run()` and prints a message indicating that the call was successful. Create a few threads of these two types, then run them and see what happens.

7. Write a method, pass an object to it, and print out all the classes in the object hierarchy.

8. Write a program to determine if a Char array is a basic data type or a real object.
